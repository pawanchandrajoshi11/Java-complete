POLYMORPHISM - same name but acts differently in different situations.

Polymorphism -> two types:  

1. Compile Time Polymorphism -> Polymorphism done in compile time. eg: Method Overloading
    during compilation process, compiler knows which method to call on which condition.

2. Run Time Polymorphism -> Polymorphism done in run time. eg: Method Overriding
    during the compile time, compiler cannot tell which method is going to run as more than 
    2 classes (inheritance) might have the same named* function present inside, hence only at the run-time 
    it could find out which one ran.
