# ANNOTATIONS

- Annotations in Java provide additional information to the compiler and JVM. 
- An annotation is a tag representing metadata about classes, interfaces, variables, methods, or fields. 
- Annotations do not impact the execution of the code that they annotate.

```java

@Override // it overrides the statements

@Deprecated // used before a class to show the class is not in use, although the class is working but it is not recommended to use for better practice, like an order version of something

```
